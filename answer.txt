First, to figure out how many times the map method is invoked, I declared a static variable to serve as a counter. Then, simply inside the map method of the TokenizerMapper class, I incremented this variable. I know that this method is called when a line is mapped because it is set as the job's mapper class. After the job is completed, a file is created called "map-count" in the user specified output directory, and the mapCount variable's value is written to the file. My solution to the given input is: 258.
